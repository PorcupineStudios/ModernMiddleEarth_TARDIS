# LOTR Port (Minecraft 1.21.1 NeoForge)

Future-port of The Lord of the Rings Mod (1.7.10, Update 36.15) to Minecraft 1.21.1, part of the TARDIS: Ring Bearer
modpack project. Mod id `lotr_port`, main class `LotrPort`, package
`com.porcupinestudios.lotrport`.

**Keep this repo private** (it holds both mods). LOTR's code belongs to Mevans and has no public source or license to
redistribute. The reference is the compiled jar `libs/LOTRMod v36.15.jar` in PorcupineStudios/RingRealms; its class map:
https://claude.ai/artifact/KqhSSTCuKXGuwKHBoYJdcu. Rebuild features in modern code; never paste decompiled code.

## Approach (agreed in the project thread)
- Split the old `LOTRMod` god class into one registry per area.
- Player/world state (old `LOTRPlayerData`, `LOTRLevelData`) as saved data and data attachments with Codecs.
- Factions and alignment first (most things depend on them, and RingRealms and the TARDIS mod read them).
- NPCs: two data-driven bases, people (humanoids with records, jobs, speech) and creatures (animals, monsters), not one
  class per race. NPCs stay light and get a saved person record only when they matter (hired, named, recruited...).
- World gen as data: biomes, structures (`.nbt` templates), loot tables. A converter that runs the old mod and exports
  structures, recipes and models as data is the planned big time-saver.
- RingRealms (colonies and realms, PorcupineStudios/RingRealms on 1.7.10) is part of this mod, in `colony` and `realm`
  packages: colonists build on the NPC base, realms register as factions. Its `docs/` folder is the feature list; its
  code is ours, so its logic can be carried over, but the LOTR-internals and reflection layer goes away.
- Middle-earth is a start dimension for TARDIS: Ring Bearer: offer it through the shared API's crash-site provider,
  and register `lotr_port:alignment`-style condition types there. Never depend on `tardis/`.

## Decisions (Aaron, 2026-11-03)
- Reuse LOTR's textures, sounds and map image (private play).
- Middle-earth is a world type, as in the original; in a normal world it is a dimension players travel to.
- Many LOTR systems get redesigned around RingRealms, Create and the TARDIS rather than copied.
- Prefer writing scripts that do the repetitive work (export, generate, rename) over porting class by class by hand.

## Build
From the repo root: `./gradlew :lotr:build`, `:lotr:runClient`, `:lotr:runServer`, `:lotr:runGameTestServer`,
`:lotr:runData`. Shared rules are in the root `CLAUDE.md`.
